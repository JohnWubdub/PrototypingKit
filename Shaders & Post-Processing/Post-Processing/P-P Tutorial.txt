What is Post Processing?
It's an easy way to add visual polish to your game. Think of it like a filter for your camera! 

How do I obtain this power?
Follow these steps once your scene is ready!

1. Import the post processing package by going to your package manager

2. Create an empty game object, this will be where our post processing effects are housed

3. Add a "Post-process Volume" component onto the empty game object and create a new Profile

4. Create a layer for the post processing effects to reside on and assign the object to this layer

Now you should have an object on the newly created post-processing layer that has Post-process Volume component with new profile

5. Add a Grain effect by clicking the "Add effect..." button on the bottom of the volume component

6. Click the drop down tab and check the boxes of the effect so it's now active

7. Select the camera you want the post processing effect to appear on and add the "Post-process Layer" component

8. Change the layer to be the post processing layer you made in step 4

Congratualtions! You should be able to see your post processing effect!

9. Now play around with all the effects for like 2 hours! (You can add more effects by making your own or finding them online.)

10. Go outside, nerd.
